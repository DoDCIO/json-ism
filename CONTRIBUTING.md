# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in helping improve the JSON Internet Security Markings (JSON-ISM) Standard as part of the Enterprise API for Data Sharing (EADS) initiative.  By contributing to the JSON-ISM Standard, you are helping establish a standard methodology for exposing banner line security markings and dissemination controls as part of a JSON API response within the Department of Defense that will enable a better data security and developer experience (DX) for consumers of various data sets within the department.

## Questions/Issues

In order to collaborate with the JSON-ISM Standard repository, you must first create an issue or question in the `Issues` tab for this repository.

#### To Open an Issue

An issue should be opened when you would like to propose an update to the Standard (which will be followed by a pull request)

To learn more about opening an issue, please visit [Creating an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

#### Opening a Question

A question should be opened when you are uncertain about something documented in the Standard and need clarification.

To create a question, use the [same process for creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), and select the label `question` on submission (it's a magenta colored box)

## Pull Request Process

The `master` branch is a reserved branch that cannot be pushed to directly and can only be altered by submitting a pull request to the branch.  In fact, no `write` actions can be performed on the main EADS repository unless you are a member of the EADS team.  (Foreshadowing the need for forking)

The process for creating a pull request is...
* Create a fork of the JSON-ISM Standard Repo.  To learn more about creating a fork, please visit [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

* Make the necessary updates (based on what you think should be changed in the JSON-ISM standard) to a branch in your local repository

* Push all changes to your fork's remote origin hosted by GitHub (typically `origin`), so for example:

```
git push origin feature/readme-typo
```

* Then create a pull request on GitHub from your forked branch to the `develop` branch (base branch) of the main JSON-ISM Standard repository.  Click to find more information on [Creating a Pull Request From a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

* The pull request will then be reviewed by EADS team.

## Collaboration
We welcome and appreciate all suggestions, questions, and pull requests into the JSON-ISM Standard repository.  As suggestions and pull requests are made, the EADS team will open communication up directly to contributors to better understand the requests being made and help resolve how (or if) they should be incorporated into the Standard.  This exchange will typically happen in the comments section for issues, questions, and pull requests.

Though the goal of this open repository is collaboration, the EADS Team has the final authority over what will be accepted.
